# Admin scripts for Minecraft Bedrock

This repo contains scripts for managing [a containerized Minecraft Bedrock server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server/actions) (With Podman in this case), with backups managed by Snapper.

The scripts and configs do not support multiple servers for now, and are set up to manage my own SMP (Cheesecraft) by default. You can easily modify them to manage your own server setup instead.
